# RhB-Xak-9459-1-150-scale
Body shell for the RhB Xak 9459 service coach in 1:150 scale.  Compatible with Kato RhB models

The body shell was designed using the data plate information (length over buffers) combined
with measurements taken from photos found online.  RhB Stations is a great photo source.

The shell is designed to fit onto a modified Kato EW1 coach chassis.  I shortened the chassis
and removed the underframe detail, saving the boxes to reapply after the conversion.  I also
narrowed the chassis to fit within the 3D printed shell.  For now, I am using one of the end
step units for the overhanging platform.  

I have put recesses inside the windows to make window glazing easier.  

This is version 2.0 - I am making some updates for better printing and adding some details.

Enjoy!
